@workspace I need a technical report describing the project. Include a comprehensive description of all classes.

@workspace can you review and recommend improvements of the PayrollLibrary project?

What are the key features of the project?

@workspace how do I scaffold test files for the employee classes in the 'PayrollLibrary' project?

@workspace Recommend a table design to match the employee class hierarchy in the 'src' folder. Use T-SQL to create the tables.

@workspace show me T-SQL commands to create an 'Employees' table with a one-to-one relationship to an 'HourlyEmployees' table and a one-to-one relationship to a 'SalariedEmployees' table. The tables should model the classes: 'Employee' , 'SalariedEmployee', 'HourlyEmployee' in the 'PayrollLibrary' project.
